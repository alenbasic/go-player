# go-player

This is a conversion of sto-player to golang. 

Not all of the features have been implemented yet, but it's most of the way there. All that is currently left to do is enabling to functionality to send commands to omx player (such as pausing it, or skipping forward/backward). Being able to display, start and end the films has already been implemented. Check back in a few days and I should be all done by then.

Note: Yes, I know it's rather hackish at the moment, I'll tidy it up.
