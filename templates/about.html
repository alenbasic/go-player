{{define "content"}}<h2>sto-player</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
sto-player is a basic web interface to OMXPlayer. Start it up with <code>python omxplayer.py</code> and go to <code>http:\\ip-of-RPi:8080</code> for the fun to begin. 
<h3>Requirements</h3>
sto-player depends on web.py and popen. You can install both of those with either easy_install or pip (or manually if you really want), which may or may not be preinstalled on your RPi distribution of choice. Check the distrobution's documentation to find out.
<h3>How to Use</h3>
 You give it a list of directories, it takes care of the rest. The interface is pretty straight forward I believe, so I don't think there is much of a need of an explanation. Since there is always room for improvement, feel free to contact me regarding improvements or suggestions to the interface or the application itself.
<h3>License</h3>
sto-player is released under the v3 of the GPL, please refer to the LICENSE file for more information.
